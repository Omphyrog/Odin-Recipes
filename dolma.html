        <h1>Description:</h1>
        <p>Pronounced ‘tolma’ in Armenia, <em>dolma</em> is another dish you may recognise and think you know.
           Made from a mix of minced meat, onion, rice, and various spices, all wrapped up in a vine leaf, they are a staple across the eastern Mediterranean.
           But there’s something different about the Armenia <em>dolma</em> – both on how they are prepared and in the ingredients used.</p>

        <p>Every Armenian grandmother has their own <em>dolma</em> recipe, but all agree that the key is in how you prepare the leaves.
           The key is to remove them from boiling water as soon as they change colour.</p>

        <p>Armenians are also more adventurous with ingredients, too.
           Expect to find lentils, tomatoes, courgette, aubergine, mint, red peppers, coriander and onions as well as the more traditional rice.</p>

        <p>Keep an eye out for the special dolma produced especially for Easter.
           ingredients are largely the same, but the vine leaves are replaced with cabbage leaves.</p>
        
        <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>500g minced beef</li>
            <li>150g rice</li>
            <li>3 medium fine chopped onions</li>
            <li>3 cloves chopped garlic</li>
            <li>1 big bunch of coriander and parsley</li>
            <li>150g tomato sauce</li>
            <li>15g salt</li>
            <li>3g black pepper</li>
            <li>300g grape leaves</li>
            <li>1 cup plain yoghurt</li>
            <li>15g chopped mint</li>
            <li>1 clove chopped garlic for the sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Instructions:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix all ingredients, except rice and grape leaves, well by hand.</li>
            <li>Add rice and mix by hand. For those who don’t eat rice for some reason , they can make it without rice!</li>
            <li>If using fresh grape leaves, cut off the stems and blanch them in boiling water first. But if you are using canned leaves, wash in hot water.</li>
            <li>Next, prep your pot. Place some grape leaves on the bottom of a medium to large pot to prevent the dolma from sticking.</li>
            <li>Now the fun part. Spread a leaf on a plate or cutting board, wrong side up and stem end towards you.
                Put a teaspoon of filling near the stem end. With your hands fold the sides and then roll up like a cigar.</li>
            <li>Place the rolled dolma in the pot. Layer the dolma in two or three layers.</li>
            <li>To ensure stability, place a plate over the top and fill the pot with 2 cups of water. You can add more tomato sauce for extra flavor.</li>
            <li>Heat stove to 150C, and cook for 50 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sauce: yoghurt, mint and garlic mix together. Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>
